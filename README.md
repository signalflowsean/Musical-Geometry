# Musical Geometry
## Chapter 1: The Five Components of Tonality
### The Five Features

1. Conjunt Melodic Motion
2. Acoustic Consonance
3. Harmonic Consistency 
4. Limited Macroharmony
5. Centricity

### The Four Claims
1. Harmony and counterpoint constrain one another
2. Scale, macroharmony, and centricity are independent
3. Modulation involves voice leading
4. Music can be understood geometrically 

### Pitch Spaces
**Linear Pitch Space**: Octave is important   
**Circular Pitch-Class Space**: Octave is *not* important

### Geometrical Analogies
Translation = Transposition  
Inversion = Reflection  
**Registral Inversion** = C4-E4-G4 --> E4-G4-C5
**Pitch-space-inversion** = C4-E4-G4 --> G4-Eb4-C4 

### Musical Objects
*Symmetry operations will leave the "essential identity" unchanged* 

| Operation         | Allowable Action           
| -------------     |:-------------:| 
| Octave            | Move *any* note into a new octave | 
| Permutation       | Reoder the object (*rotate*)      |   
| Transposition     | Move *all* of its notes in the same                             direction by the same amount      |    
| Inversion         | Turn the object "upside down"     |       
| Cardinality Change| Add a new voice duplicating one of                              the notes in the new object       |

**Chord**: octave shifts, permutations, and note-dulication  
**Multiset**: octave shifts, and permutation  
**Tone Row**: shift octaves, and note-duplication  

*With chord-progressions one can apply the symmetry operations to the musical objects individually or uniformally* 

## Voice Leading and Chord Progressions
**Chord Progression**: A series of *un-ordered* musical objects 
**Voice Leading**: A series of *ordered* musical objects

| Term              | Symmetry           
| -------------     |:-------------:| 
| Voice leading in pitch space             | uniform  **P** | 
| Voice leading in pitch-class space       | uniform **OP** |   
| Pitch-space chord progression            | individual **PC** |
| Chord progression                        | individual **OPC**|
| Path in pitch-class space                | uniform **O**     |
