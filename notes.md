# Musical Geometry
## Chapter 1: The Five Components of Tonality
### The Five Features

1. Conjunt Melodic Motion
2. Acoustic Consonance
3. Harmonic Consistency 
4. Limited Macroharmony
5. Centricity

### The Four Claims
1. Harmony and counterpoint constrain one another
2. Scale, macroharmony, and centricity are independent
3. Modulation involves voice leading
4. Music can be understood geometrically
